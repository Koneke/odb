Small, basic, classic-style roguelike, inspired by Rogue, Nethack, Angband, and their friends.

General state of it at the moment is that most of the basic systems are in, i.e. weapons, armour, wands, scrolls, melee, ranged and magic combat, a basic time system, weapon modifiers, and what not. No level generation yet, general idea is to build a small hardcoded game first, see what works and what not, and go from there.

Goal with the project is not to make something new or revolutionizing, but mainly to just create a small, polished game with fun bits and pieces picked together.
